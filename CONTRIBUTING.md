# Establishing Norms

## What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
- The whole group gets involved to make a decision

## What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
- Bring it up to the team sooner rather than later, feel comfortable in telling everyone on the team that you are frustrated

## What does this group do when we merge our work together?
- Merge it together
- Do a “code reading” after the morning stand-up; read your code out loud to the team line-by-line 

## When does this group ask for help?
- After 15 minutes, as soon as you think it’s a waste of time to not ask for help 
- Ask the rest of the group but if they don’t have an answer…
- Help ticket

## How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
- On a feature basis when we think we need to pair, not a fixed amount of time but try to be balanced (at 30 min, bring it up...)

## How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
- If you plan on working afterwards, try to make it clear to each other what you’re going to do… avoid repeat work.

- First thing in the morning, right after lunch both good times
- Touchbase at 4 MST / 5 CST / 6 EST
