# App Goals

- Avoid paradox of choice
- Reduce time to get food

# MVP

- Log in (as user)
- Create user profile (username, password, name, default spending, default distance, fav cuisines, email)
- Rank restaurants for a user based on location, restaurant hours / time of day for appropriate meal, and 'Savor Score' algorithm
- Open app and see current location with your recommended food
- See more items for selected restaurant
- See other restaurants in sorted priority
- Can navigate to restaurant using default map app on phone

### Should have completed for final

- Log in (as restaurant)
- Mark your favorite restaurants / trucks
- Rate restaurants
- Purchase an item and get a confirmation
- Keep track of order history and let them reorder, but also keep recommending new things

### Nice to have

- Suggest location to a food truck based on where users that have favorited it are
- Allow user to set food allergies and preferences
- You can 'follow' your fav food trucks and get notified when they're nearby
- Register as restaurant / food truck and input menu via form

### _VERY_ nice to have

- Restaurant can view incoming orders while logged in (requires socket.io)
- Mark as complete
- Truck can update location and send a tweet automatically
- Restaurant menu includes tags for each item, so they can be filtered based on user-preferences

## Tech Hurdles

- Realtime GPS location shown on a map
- React native implementation
- Card swiping UI with ratcheting mechanic
- Learning how to use Firebase
- Handing off nav to default map app
- sockets.io

---

### Things to think about

- Twilio
- Break down the send/receiving orders into tiers

## Proof of concept

- have dev environments set up well
- react-native app that shows GPS location
